--BinaryCounter approximates the Heaviside Function in order to count in binary, as the name suggests

--When calling the countBinary function, input the number of bits you want to work with into the bitCount parameter, and the number you want to count to in the countTo parameter.
    --Remember that you can't count to any number that is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of bitCount.

--Let me know if you have any questions or feedback!
